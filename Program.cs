// Entry point for the WinForms application. This file ties the executable to the UI defined in
// frmMain (the main form constructed in M18AnalyzerMain.cs / M18AnalyzerMain.Designer.cs) and uses
// ApplicationConfiguration to bootstrap high-DPI awareness and default fonts. The goal is to show
// how a C# WinForms app starts, how STAThread is required for COM-based UI components, and where the
// program transitions from the process boundary into user-interface code that eventually invokes
// serial-protocol logic in M18Protocol.cs and USB enumeration utilities in FtdiDeviceUtil.cs. Even
// though the logic is minimal, commenting every line reveals the basic structure of a .NET desktop
// program for newcomers.
